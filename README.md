# Dark Skies 7

Some future text about the project

**This example features VueJS 2.x.**

## How-to

**Install NPM dependencies and build static files**

``` bash
npm install
```

**Test in iOS**

``` bash
npm run ios
```

**Test in browser**

``` bash
npm run browser
```

> Testing in the browser only allows you to test a very few plugins as Cordova emulates poorly most plugins in the browsers. This can still be useful to tweak the demo app quickly (hot reloading, yay!), instead of building the script files each time you want to preview your changes.
